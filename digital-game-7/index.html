<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I dont think most people like to speed shop for groceries. I have this weird habit that when I go grocery shopping I try to be quick and time myself. People blocking me slows me down or I don't buy that item. Weird but I do it when I shop alone
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Use of tilemap for the first time. Simple If-elses that make the game fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learning how to make tilemaps is difficult because you have to picture your game background.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Player: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-girl-variant-2">Player</a></li>
<li>People: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/alternate-lpc-character-sprites-george">People</a></li>
<li>Tileset: <a href="https://kauzzresources.wordpress.com/galeria/">Tileset</a></li>
<li>Music: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples/assets/audio/SoundEffects">Music</a></li>
<li>Tilemap: Made it myself</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is slightly close to the physical prototype. I changed a lot because while play testing I found my idea to be to generic. An I decided to make the theme on a market place because it seemed unique never seen a speed shopper game. Instead of traps you have people and you have to collect 6 items instead of one treasure. Each person can take turns playing the game and note down their time. The fastest wins. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a person who likes to speed shop. Try collecting all your grocery and pay for them as fast as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Input: Keyboard</li>
    <li>Randomness: Not much</li>
    <li>Play Stayles: Competitor, Joker, Collector</li>
    <li>Genres: Platformer, RPG (i think of it as one)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? : Phaser's Tilemaps
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Have fun and get frustrated.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic goal is to collect all 6 grocery items while avoiding people and then paying for them. Do all this as fast as you can.
Controls - Arrow keys (left,right,up,down)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Be Patient
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You live in a normal world were people enjoy grocery shopping at a normal pace. But you are an impatient person, you watch videos at 2 times the normal speed, you tell people to get to the point faster during coversations and you speed shop. You have been told to get grocery but you want to get back to your netflix at 2 times the speed as fast as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each try should'nt take more than 3 minutes
</li>
