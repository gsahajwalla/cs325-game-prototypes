<h2>Catch the Ghost</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is random and deterministic at the same time. Never seen a ghost catching game like this one.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Use of time based functions to make everything work in sync.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to work with time based functions and how multiple states work (but only used two states the others were causing catching problems)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
No
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch the ghost is a platfomer game where the overall objective is for the player to catch the ghost
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Used the theme Caught
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Input: Mouse (also added keyboard incase player does not have a mouse)</li>
    <li>Randomness: A lot of it and also deterministic at the same time</li>
    <li>Play Styles: Joker (the game can be annoying at times)</li>
    <li>Genere: Platformer</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Phaser's time based functions
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
My overall goal is for the player to have fun
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic premise of the game is to move around and catch the ghost. At times (every 30 secs) a star appears and if the player collects it they can fly for 5 seconds

<ol>
    <li>To move left use left click (or the left arrow key)</li>
    <li>To move right use the right click (or right arrow key</li>
    <li>To jump use the middle scroll click (or the up key)</li>
    <li>If star consumed left click on places where you want to go <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/follow-mouse">Example</a></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Be patient and after playing the game for sometime you will find easier ways to catch the ghost
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
So you are a ghost hunter, you have heard that there is a ghost around the graveyard and you have been assigned the task to catch this ghost.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who has the time to play web browser games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
~ 5 to 10 mins 
</li>
