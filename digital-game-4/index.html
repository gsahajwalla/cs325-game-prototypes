<h2>Horse Racing</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A webed based horse race betting game prototype, thought horse racing is not unique the game idea kind of is.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Everything is random, even how fast the horses run so that makes it like an actual race. Also added homestate, betting state and the game state
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Setting up the different states and how to distribute code is what I learnt.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Made most of the assets from scratch except the horse and the horse cartoon at the start.
<li>Horse and Jockey <a href=" http://moziru.com/explore/Horse%20Racing%20clipart%20cartoon/">Horse and Jockey</a></li>
<li>Horse Spritesheet <a href="https://opengameart.org/node/77472">Horse Spritesheet</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Have not used anyother prototype
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
So the overall goal is to bet on a horse and hope that it wins the race.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Gambler
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ol>Input: Indirect</ol>
<ol>Randomness</ol>
<ol>Compitetor (Can be a multiplayer game just bet on a horse see if you win)</ol>
<ol>Racing</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Physics engine for the most part.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to enjoy this virtual gambling so much that they never gamble in the real world.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ol>So after the loading screen shows you will be at a page that has the <strong>Bet</strong> button</ol>
<ol>After you click on it you have to choose a horse by clicking on the horse you want</ol>
<ol>Watch as the horses race and hope that your horse wins</ol>
<ol>Refersh page to play again</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are no real startegies in horse racing other than bribing the jockeys (might add that)
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player (you) is addicted to gambling, you need to pay off loan sharks so you think the best way to get the money is through more gambling. Everything is on the line for you, this one race decides whether you have broken bones or not.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone except people who have real gambling issues
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
~2 to 3 minutes
</li>

</ul>
