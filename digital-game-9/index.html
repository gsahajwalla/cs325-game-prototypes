<h2>Speed Shopper</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I dont think most people like to speed shop for groceries. I have this weird habit that when I go grocery shopping I try to be quick and time myself. People blocking me slows me down or I don't buy that item. Weird but I do it when I shop alone
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Use of tilemap for the first time. Simple If-elses that make the game fun. Also added multiple levels
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learning how to make tilemaps is difficult because you have to picture your game background.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Tilemap: Made it myself</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is very similar to the first digital iteration. A new level is added and instead of the game ending right away after touching a bad guy, it is time based. 
<strong>Note for TA </strong>So I got points taken off because the collision happened even when the player was adjacent to the objects, but that was the point of the game if you are adjacent to the item/store person you collide.
Also the box collision is weird at times because of the tilesheet (which counts as artwork) so I don't have control over that 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a person who likes to speed shop. Try collecting all your grocery and pay for them as fast as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None
</li>

    <li>Randomness: Not much</li>
    <li>Play Stayles: Competitor, Joker, Collector</li>
    <li>Genres: Platformer, RPG (i think of it as one)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? : Phaser's Tilemaps
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Have fun and get frustrated.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic goal is to collect all 6 grocery items while avoiding people and then paying for them. Do all this as fast as you can.
Controls - Arrow keys (left,right,up,down)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Be Patient.
Learn how to use the teleport to your advantage
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You live in a normal world were people enjoy grocery shopping at a normal pace. But you are an impatient person, you watch videos at 2 times the normal speed, you tell people to get to the point faster during coversations and you speed shop. You have been told to get grocery but you want to get back to your netflix at 2 times the speed as fast as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
