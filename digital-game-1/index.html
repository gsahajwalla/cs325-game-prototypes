<h2>Bouncy Golf</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is a fun version of golf, the player has to try to hit the ball into the hole at the corner.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It uses physics and sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I got even more familiar with phaser (have used it before) and I got to refresh certain concepts. Making and using assets was a bit tricky. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made certain assests from scratch and some from phaser examples and other places.
<ul>
<li>Background image: <a href="http://www.spriteland.com/">Background</a></li>
    <li>Player: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples">Player</a></li>
<li>Ball: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples">Ball</a></li>
<li>Sound: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples">Sound</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not borrow the idead from anywhere, it was just a game I built as I kept adding assests keeping a golfer theme in mind. As far as borrowed code goes I either looked up documentation or used the phaser examples for certain small things (like how to add sound).
<li>Phaser Examples: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples">Phaser Examples</a> </li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The overall goal is to get the ball in the hole (just like golf).
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Golfer.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Not Sure
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The overall prototype goal is to test physics and sounds in phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Just have fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player around, the up arrow key to jump. Try to hit the ball as it bounces into the hole.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Do not jump on the ball oftened as this decreased the ball's bounce. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Not applicable for this prototype
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone who likes to play really simple games to pass time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It can take upto 5 to 10 mins for getting the ball into the hole once. Maybe less if the player is lucky or really good at it. 
</li>
