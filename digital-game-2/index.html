<h2>Pet Chicken</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
There are not any web based virtual pet simulators specially one for a chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
All the sprites in the game depend on each other. Use of this alot
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learnt how to accept input when you click on a sprite. Acceptin mouse input and fixing errors.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Made all the sprites except the chick and sleeping button</li>
<li>Chick: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples">Chick</a></li>
<li>Sleep: <a href="https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/3819668/418938184/stock-vector-zzz-sleeping-night-sign-icon-418938184.jpg">Sleep</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Did not see a phaser example similar to my game but a bit of inspiration from nintendo pets
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Keep your chicken alive for the longest you can pressing the button to feed and pet the chicken and to make the chicken sleep.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Input: Keyboard and Clickable Buttons </li>
	<li>Randomness: a lot of randomness</li>
	<li>Genre: Achiever (Trying to keep the chicken alive for as long as possible) </li>
	<li>Playstyle: Not sure in this case</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
How to change custom params of a sprite and accept mouse input
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Learn that taking care of a pet is very difficult
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use arrow keys to move chicken towards the seed (yellow) and insect (brown). Also clickable buttons at the bottom to feed, pet and put the chicken to sleep. Keep track of health and love. If you put the chicken to sleep you cant move or eat. You have to use pet to wake the chicken up.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep track of your resouces try and collect as much free seed as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game you are a person who owns a chicken. It's the only thing that you have left and you are trying to keep it alive for as long as possible. What makes the chicken interesting is that it moves faster than a real chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is everyone who has ever wanted to own a virtual pet
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 to 10 mins
</li>

</ul>
